## **RECURSION**

##### CONCEPTS:
[implementing recursion, utilization of recursive helper methods, base cases, Unit Testing Development]

##### PURPOSE:
- recursion: To solve problems using recursive method as opposed to iterative. To do so, the program calls several methods that travel down  a 'list' object using recursion to: find an element in the list smaller than element in parameter, find the last index of an element in the list, insert the element an appropriate spot in the list.
- recursive helpers: the use of helper methods that are continuously called and facilitate the recursive process. 
- base cases: returns a value without making any subsequent recursive calls

### COURSE: Program Design and Data Structures
